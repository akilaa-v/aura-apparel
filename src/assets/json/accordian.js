    content: `At Aura Apparel, we strive to ensure you're delighted with your purchase. If you're not fully satisfied, we accept returns within 30 days of delivery, provided items are in original condition (unworn, unwashed, with tags attached). Certain items, such as underwear, swimwear, and final sale items, are non-returnable for hygiene and clearance reasons. To initiate a return, log into your account, select the items for return, and ship them back using the prepaid label provided. Please note that return shipping costs may apply. Once your return is received and inspected, we will process your refund within 5-7 business days to the original payment method or as store credit for gift card purchases. We do not offer direct exchanges, so to exchange an item, simply place a new order after your refund is processed. If your order arrives damaged or defective, please reach out to us within 7 days for a replacement or full refund. For questions, our support team is available at support@auraapparel.com.`
